# Fundamentals of Electricity

### The big four

The four properties that drive the entire industry of electricity are:

- Voltage
- Current
- Resistance
- Power

If you know what is going on with voltage, current, resistance and power, you know what is going on inside the circuit.

Everything that it pertains to electricity and electronics is traceable back to Matter. Matter is anything that occupies space and has weight.

### Elements

- Basic building blocks of nature.
- Cannot be reduced to a simpler substance by chemical means.
- Over 100 known elements (literally **everything** is made out of these 100 plus elements).

### Parts of an atom

- Nucleus
  - Located at center of atom.

- Protons
  - Positively charged particles inside nucleus.

- Neutrons
  - Uncharged particles inside nucleus.

- Electrons
  - Negatively charged particles that orbit nucleus.

As an electronic technician the most important part of an atom is the Electrons.

### Electric charge

Charge is an electrical property of the atomic particles that makes up the matter, measured in
Coulumbs (C).

The electric charge of an electron is negative and have a magnitude of 1.162 x 10¯¹⁶, in the other
hand a proton os positively charged with the same magnitude of the electron. An atom having the same
number os protons and electrons has a neutral charge.

### Electric current

Current is the flow of charge per unit of time, measured in ampères (A). 

Mathematically, the relation among current (i), charge (q) and time (t) is:

```
    dq
i ≜ -
    dt
```

where the current is measured in ampères and `1 ampère = 1 coulumb/second`.

André-Marie Ampère (1775-1836) defined electric current and developed a way to measure it.

### Current types

#### Direct current

A direct current (I) is a current that remains constant over time.

#### Alternating current

An alternating current (i) is a current that varies over time, having a sine wave shape.

### Voltage

### Law of conservation of charge

This law says that the charges can't be created or destroyed, only transferred. Then the sum of all
electric charges of a system is constant.
